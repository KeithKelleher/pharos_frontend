      <p>
        Filter value counts, as reported on the left panel, show which filter values are the most common for targets in the list.
        These raw counts are sometimes dominated by filter values that are much more likely to be found than others.
        This tool calculates which filter values are enriched, or over-represented, in the current list. The odds ratio of
        observing a given count of values is presented, as is as the p-value using Fisher's Exact test. Significance is determined
        according to an alpha = 0.05, adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the False Discovery Rate.</p>

      <mat-card-subtitle>Potential Use Cases</mat-card-subtitle>

      <ul>
        <li>
          For a list of interacting proteins to a target of interest (click 'Explore Interacting Targets' from a target
          details page), what values for 'Associated Disease' are overrepresented in the list?
        </li>
        <li>
          For a list of targets generated from your RNA-SEQ experiment, and uploaded to your profile as a custom target
          list (see the tutorial 'Uploading a Custom Target List' for a walkthrough), what 'Reactome Pathways' are overrepresented?
        </li>
        <li>
          For a list of ligands that are structurally similar to a compound of interest (see the tutorial 'Searching by Chemical Structure' for a walkthrough),
          what Targets have activity against those ligands?
        </li>
       </ul>

        <p>You are viewing the full list. Filter value representation is done by comparing a filtered list to the full list.
          Select some filter options, or generate a list based on an associated target, disease, or ligand, etc. to see which
          filter values are over-represented in the list.</p>
