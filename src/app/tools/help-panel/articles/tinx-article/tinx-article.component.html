    <a href = "https://www.newdrugtargets.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TIN-X</a> is an interactive visualization tool for discovering interesting associations
    between diseases and potential drug targets.</p>
    <p>We used natural language processing to identify disease and protein mentions in the text
      of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PubMed</a>
      abstracts. Using this data, we derived two metrics: <strong>novelty</strong> and <strong>importance</strong>.
      Novelty measures the
      relative scarcity of specific publications about a given concept (such as a target or a disease),
      while importance measures the relative strength of the association between two concepts. We then built
      this web tool, which enables users to explore the relationships between the novelty of potential drug targets
      and their importance to diseases.</p>
    <p>Our approach was guided by the following assumptions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A target that is mentioned in many abstracts that also mention a specific disease is likely to be of
        importance to that disease.
      </li>
      <li>A target or disease that is mentioned in fewer abstracts is more novel and less well understood.</li>
      <li>Abstracts which mention only a few targets and diseases are more specific and should be given greater weight
        than those which mention many.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more details about how these scores are computed, please see the paper cited below.</p></div>
